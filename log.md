# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 4, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Did a [GitHub Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and forked this repository. 

**Thoughts:** The GitHub learning curve is steep! I've been practicing Git for a month or two now, but this is my first time really using GitHub. Luckily, it's mostly the same sort of thing, just not in Command Line. I managed to do a couple pull requests, but I accidentally tried to merge my branch with the master and not with my forked repo! That was horrifying. But I'll get better as I go, I'm sure! Onward! 

### Day 2: July 5, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed JavaScript basics and did research on current web design standards.

**Thoughts:** Was away from my laptop, so I did some review and research from my phone. I'm going to be glad when summer vacation rolls around and I'm not so exhausted after work every day! I'm glad my Computer Science work is carrying over to JavaScript concepts, though; I really struggled with it at first. 

### Day 3: July 6, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Did some work on a Computer Science project involving Command Line and Git concepts.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely starting to feel a bit more comfortable with Command Line and Git, but it's still really hard and scary for me to do work outside of in-browser text editors. I suppose that'll be one of my big pushes with this project! 

### Day 4: July 7, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed CSS concepts and read some articles about them.

**Thoughts:** I'm not getting as much done with this as I'd like, but hopefully I can start to make some real progress soon. Motivation is low, but I guess that's why we have willpower. 

### Day 5: July 8, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Slow going today. Will have to really hit JavaScript hard when I get off work for the summer.

### Day 6: July 9, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed some Python syntax and did some Git research.

**Thoughts:** Some things are starting to better click for me, but it's still taking some time for me to figure out how to think more logically. I guess that's the trouble with coming from a design background. Today I also researched the tense of Git commits because of a question from another server user, and learned more about that! 

### Day 7: July 10, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Updated this log, cleaned up my GitHub account, and worked on a CS project (Boredless Tourist).

**Thoughts:** I'm becoming more comfortable with GitHub readonly edits at this point, but I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what it can do. I also spent quite a bit of time getting stuck on a step of the CS project, but I finally figured out how to make it work. That's always a nice feeling! I'm definitely more comfortable with Python than JavaScript, but hopefully the concepts will keep transferring well.  

### Day 8: July 11, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Created my first GitHub issue and worked on a CS project (Boredless Tourist).

**Thoughts:** I was able to create an issue for a suggested feature for our Discord community bot today, which was exciting! I got to learn more about how that works, and now I want to go find other repos that have open issues that are good for beginners to work on. It could be fun! I also struggled with Python some more today, but I got it to do what I wanted it to do in the end. Functions calling other functions can get tricky, especially when scoped variables get involved...

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
