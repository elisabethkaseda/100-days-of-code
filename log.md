# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 4, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Did a [GitHub Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and forked this repository. 

**Thoughts:** The GitHub learning curve is steep! I've been practicing Git for a month or two now, but this is my first time really using GitHub. Luckily, it's mostly the same sort of thing, just not in Command Line. I managed to do a couple pull requests, but I accidentally tried to merge my branch with the master and not with my forked repo! That was horrifying. But I'll get better as I go, I'm sure! Onward! 

### Day 2: July 5, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed JavaScript basics and did research on current web design standards.

**Thoughts:** Was away from my laptop, so I did some review and research from my phone. I'm going to be glad when summer vacation rolls around and I'm not so exhausted after work every day! I'm glad my Computer Science work is carrying over to JavaScript concepts, though; I really struggled with it at first. 

### Day 3: July 6, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Did some work on a Computer Science project involving Command Line and Git concepts.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely starting to feel a bit more comfortable with Command Line and Git, but it's still really hard and scary for me to do work outside of in-browser text editors. I suppose that'll be one of my big pushes with this project! 

### Day 4: July 7, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed CSS concepts and read some articles about them.

**Thoughts:** I'm not getting as much done with this as I'd like, but hopefully I can start to make some real progress soon. Motivation is low, but I guess that's why we have willpower. 

### Day 5: July 8, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Slow going today. Will have to really hit JavaScript hard when I get off work for the summer.

### Day 6: July 9, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed some Python syntax and did some Git research.

**Thoughts:** Some things are starting to better click for me, but it's still taking some time for me to figure out how to think more logically. I guess that's the trouble with coming from a design background. Today I also researched the tense of Git commits because of a question from another server user, and learned more about that! 

### Day 7: July 10, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Updated this log, cleaned up my GitHub account, and worked on a CS project (Boredless Tourist).

**Thoughts:** I'm becoming more comfortable with GitHub readonly edits at this point, but I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what it can do. I also spent quite a bit of time getting stuck on a step of the CS project, but I finally figured out how to make it work. That's always a nice feeling! I'm definitely more comfortable with Python than JavaScript, but hopefully the concepts will keep transferring well.  

### Day 8: July 11, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Created my first GitHub issue and worked on a CS project (Boredless Tourist).

**Thoughts:** I was able to create an issue for a suggested feature for our Discord community bot today, which was exciting! I got to learn more about how that works, and now I want to go find other repos that have open issues that are good for beginners to work on. It could be fun! I also struggled with Python some more today, but I got it to do what I wanted it to do in the end. Functions calling other functions can get tricky, especially when scoped variables get involved...

### Day 9: July 12, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Studied UX/UI practices and looked into portfolio projects. 

**Thoughts:** There's so much to learn! I'm not spending as much time on this per day as I probably should be, but I still feel like there's way more to do in a day than can fit in one hour. Can't wait until vacation time when I can contribute much more time to this. 

### Day 10: July 13, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed CSS Grid and some other HTML/CSS topics.

**Thoughts:** A tweet that went viral got me thinking about how important the basics are these days, when everyone is so eager to show off their knowledge of all the latest technologies. Basics are what I do best (I much prefer HTML/CSS to JavaScript), so I might as well make sure I'm REALLY good at the basics, right? I don't think I'll ever be able to beat people with JavaScript skills, but this and my passion for accessibility might possibly give me a leg up in a different way. I hope.

### Day 11: July 14, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Joined Slack for an open-source project, did more CSS review, and worked on a CS project (Boredless Tourist).

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely feeling what I mentioned in day 10: the actual programming part of things is not easy for me! It's going to take a lot of practice. But going back to CSS feels like home. I'm hoping to use more of my design skills and CSS knowledge to help with an open-source project I found that has helped so many people. It'd be an honor to be able to contribute. I've gotta work hard so I can be useful! 

### Day 12: July 15, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed CSS Grid and worked on web accessibility materials.

**Thoughts:** With how much I feel out of my depths in *programming* programming, I'm starting to wonder if it wouldn't be possible to mostly just get really good at CSS and web accessibility and passable at JavaScript. I've definitely seen a fair amount of complaining that even senior devs don't get those right some of the time! I'll work on it, anyway, and see where it gets me. 

### Day 13: July 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** More web accessibility work and learning about the UX interview process.

**Thoughts:** Not much to report today, to be honest. Just chugging along. It's been nice to have time to use my laptop at work, though.

### Day 14: July 17, 2021

**Today's Progress:** CSS review, web accessibility readings, and Command Line review.

**Thoughts:** It was the day after my COVID-19 vaccine, so I was taking it easy. Just did some readings and reviews. Only a couple more days until summer vacation! Hoping to spend some time recovering from burnout and to really get to work on all of this coding stuff. 

### Day 15: July 18, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Web accessibility practice and ARIA excercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm constantly surprised by how much there still is to learn. It's still awfully overwhelming sometimes... but I hope gathering all these resources will help me out, and that eventually I'll be able to work with these things without too much trouble. 

### Day 16: July 19, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Command Line and Git review, plus some design prep and research.

**Thoughts:** I spent the day rather annoyed because I felt all fired up to code and learn in the morning, but had to go to work instead, where I have no regular computer access. I ended up doing some design readings and research, but it still felt like wasted motivation. Summer vacation soon! (I also ended up learning a bunch more about Command Line just because of a one-off joke Tweet that I saw.)

### Day 17: July 20, 2021

**Today's Progress:** More Command Line review, GitHub prodding, and design research. 

**Thoughts:** Last day of school! Hoping I can use the next five and a half weeks to really make some good progress on this and other projects so that it's easier for me to keep it up once I go back to work in September. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed by how much there is to learn before I can do all the things I want to do, but as my mum always says, "How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time."

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
