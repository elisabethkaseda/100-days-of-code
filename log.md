# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 4, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Did a [GitHub Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and forked this repository. 

**Thoughts:** The GitHub learning curve is steep! I've been practicing Git for a month or two now, but this is my first time really using GitHub. Luckily, it's mostly the same sort of thing, just not in Command Line. I managed to do a couple pull requests, but I accidentally tried to merge my branch with the master and not with my forked repo! That was horrifying. But I'll get better as I go, I'm sure! Onward!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
